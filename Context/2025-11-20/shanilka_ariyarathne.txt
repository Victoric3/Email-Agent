Name: Shanilka Ariyarathne (Prof MAD)
Channel: Physics content creator — Prof MAD
Initial outreach: Personalized email praising her video and offered an EulaIQ sample of "The Hidden Power of Inductors — Why Coils Resist Change!".
Response Summary: Very positive — Shanilka asked for more examples and clarification on the AI-driven nature of the tool and creative controls, ownership/rights, and whether others are using it.
Status: Interested — sample requested; asked clarifying questions. Delay explanation and update included.
Delay explanation:
- The product was unstable when we first reached out; we paused follow-up to finish and stabilize the pipeline before sharing full samples. We regret the delay and appreciate the patience.
Recent progress & updates:
- Product stability: EulaIQ’s video pipeline is fully stable now and can handle diagrams, equations, and mixed camera workflows.
- Achievements: Accepted into NVIDIA Inception; awarded $100k+ AWS credits and $350k+ GCP credits.
- Sample created for "{{example_video}}" — sample link placeholder: <SHANILKA_SAMPLE_LINK>

Suggested follow-up (apologetic + update):

Subject: Apologies for the delay — your sample is ready

Hi Shanilka,

Thanks again for your interest — and apologies for the delay. We paused outreach briefly so we could send demos that are actually useful, and I created a short sample so you can see how diagrams and equations render.

I created a short sample from your video "The Hidden Power of Inductors — Why Coils Resist Change!" — watch it here: <SHANILKA_SAMPLE_LINK>

Quick details on the sample:
- We can animate only the segments you choose (diagrams, worked examples) while keeping your camera presence intact, or animate the entire video — whichever you prefer.
- For this sample we used our automated pipeline (no manual edits were applied); we’re adding creator-facing editor controls so you’ll be able to tweak visuals and timing directly before launch.
- Ownership: you retain full ownership of all generated assets; EulaIQ supplies the rendered assets under a production license and will not publish anything without your approval.

Would you like a short 15-minute walkthrough this week so I can show the equations and diagrams? If so, tell me a couple of times that work for you (timezone) or reply "Hi" and I’ll share the sample now.

Warmly,
Victor

Creator-specific clarifying questions for Victor (so I can tailor the reply precisely):
1) Confirm the `SHANILKA_SAMPLE_LINK` URL and the exact video sections animated.
2) Did the sample include equations (how complex) and did we manually adjust them or rely purely on AI rendering?
3) Would you like to offer Shanilka a specific early-access incentive (discount, credits, priority support, or co-marketing)?
4) Would you like to invite her to a short demo & test session? If yes, confirm Victor’s/CMO’s available time slots and timezone.
Next Steps:
- Prepare and send a sample of the video she mentioned.
- Answer questions: what’s AI-driven vs. what’s customizable by the creator (we can control visual timing and style presets); clarify ownership/licensing.
- Provide references or demos if any creators are testing EulaIQ currently (we have test samples; store the link).
- Offer a 15-minute demo to show how creators can keep camera segments and only animate selected parts.
Notes for personalization: Reference the specific video used and mention how EulaIQ handled technical diagrams and equations.
