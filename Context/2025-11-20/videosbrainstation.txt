Name: VideosBrainStation
Channel: Maths/Calculus educational channel
Initial outreach: Email praising their "BASIC Math Calculus" video and offering an EulaIQ sample of "No One Taught Eigenvalues & Eigen Vectors Like This".
Response Summary: Positive — creator expressed interest in seeing the sample and testing the result.
Status: Interested — follow-up required.
Delay explanation:
- We made initial contact with a proof-of-concept but the product was unstable. To make sure we deliver a high-quality sample, we paused follow-up while stabilizing our platform.
Recent progress & updates:
- The pipeline is now stable and supports mixed camera + animation segments, improved diagram rendering, and quicker sample turnaround.
- Achievements: Accepted into NVIDIA Inception; awarded $100k+ in AWS credits and $350k+ in GCP credits.
- Sample created for "No One Taught Eigenvalues & Eigen Vectors Like This" — sample link placeholder: <VIDEOSBS_SAMPLE_LINK>

Suggested follow-up (apologetic + update):
---
Subject: Apologies for the delay — your sample is ready

Apologies for the slow follow-up. We wanted to stabilise EulaIQ so any demos we sent would be useful — I made a short sample from your video so you can see how we’d animate the core example: <VIDEOSBS_SAMPLE_LINK>

Here’s a short sample we created from your video "No One Taught Eigenvalues & Eigen Vectors Like This": <VIDEOSBS_SAMPLE_LINK>

Quick notes:
- We can animate only the parts you want (worked examples, diagrams) while keeping your camera segments intact — or animate the whole video if you prefer. For camera-integration we currently recommend recombining your camera footage in your editor; native integration is planned for release.
- You keep full ownership; EulaIQ provides the generated assets and a production license for your usage — we won’t publish without your approval.
- If you want adjustments to the timing, visual style, or which sections remain on-camera, we can make that quickly.

Would you like a short 10–15 minute demo to walk through the sample? If so, reply with a couple times that work for you and we’ll book it — otherwise reply "Hi" to see the unlisted sample.

Best,
Godreigns

Creator-specific clarifying questions for Victor (so I can tailor the reply precisely):
1) Confirm the `VIDEOSBS_SAMPLE_LINK` and the exact video segments used.
2) Do we have a pre-approved summary/one-line treatment of our licensing policy (short version to include in the reply)?
3) Any early-access offer we should highlight (e.g., discount, co-marketing, priority support)?
4) Do we want to ask whether they’d be comfortable with a public mention or a testimonial if the sample works for them?
Next Steps:
- Send sample and collect creator feedback.
- Offer to show how EulaIQ can be used for short segments to complement camera presence.
- Provide clear step for early access onboarding and offer to test a current script.
Notes for personalization: Reference which older video was used for the sample and highlight how the animation supports quick conceptual understanding.
