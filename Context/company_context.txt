## Company Context: EulaIQ (Updated 2025-11-20)

### Identity & Mission
* **Company:** EulaIQ
* **Mission:** Build the "camera" for ideas. We create personalized AI instructors that teach with visuals, animations, and live explanations.
* **Current State:** NVIDIA Inception Member. $450k+ in cloud credits (AWS/GCP).
* **Founders:** Victor (CEO), Canon (CTO), Godreigns (CMO). Based in Enugu, Nigeria; targeting Bay Area/YC.

### The Product (Current)
* **Core Tech:** Audio-to-Animation AI. Converts educational voiceovers/scripts into high-fidelity, 3Blue1Brown-style animations.
* **Speed:** Renders full videos in ~10 minutes (not real-time, but near-instant batch processing).
* **Workflow:** Creator uploads audio/script -> System generates full animated video -> Creator receives finished asset.
* **Differentiation:** Handles complex diagrams, math equations, and mixed-media (integrating creator's face-cam with animation) better than generic stock footage AI.

### Outreach Strategy (The "Power Move" Pivot)
* **Philosophy:** "Don't ask for permission. Deliver value instantly."
* **Tone:** Peer-to-peer, professional, high-signal, confident. No "fanboy" praise. No apologizing.
* **The Offer:** We do not send snippets. We send **FULL** animated versions of their existing content to prove the tech works at scale.
* **Key Value Prop:** "We automate the heavy lifting of animation. You record, we render."
* **Call to Action (CTA):** Binary choice (Call vs. Async).

### Target Audience
* **Primary:** YouTube Educational Creators (Math, Science, Coding, Engineering).
* **Pain Point:** Animation is tedious, expensive, and takes weeks. EulaIQ makes it take minutes.

### The "Don't Mention" List (For Initial Outreach)
* **Do NOT mention:** That it creates a "base" animation or requires Canva for polishing (unless asked).
* **Do NOT mention:** The upcoming "Natural Language Editing UI" (sell what exists now).
* **Do NOT mention:** How long you've been watching them (avoid parasocial framing).

### Metrics & Goals
