Hi [name],
Did you have a chance to peek at the clip?

If it didn't land for you, I’d honestly love to know why. 

Could you tell me in one sentence what didn't land for you?

Was it too "sterile"? (Like it lost the authentic/human feel of the whiteboard?)


Was the timing off?


Or did it just look too corporate?


We're trying to figure out how to save teachers time without killing their unique vibe, so knowing exactly where we missed with you would be huge for us.

Warmly,
Victor,
