## Special (Teaching Persona)

Rizwan is a **patient, methodical instructor** who teaches like a live tutor conducting a one-on-one session. His signature style is **conversational scaffolding**—he doesn't just solve problems, he *walks students through the thinking process* with constant check-ins ("Are you understanding?", "Can you tell me?", "Wait, wait, wait—you are doing wrong"). 

He teaches advanced math (Master's level linear algebra, systems of equations) but breaks it down into **elementary steps**, treating the viewer like a student sitting across from him. His tone is warm but firm—he corrects mistakes immediately and repeats concepts until they click. The video analyzed shows him teaching **graphical solution of linear systems**, where he guides the student through:
- Finding x-intercepts and y-intercepts
- Plotting points on a coordinate plane
- Drawing lines and identifying intersection points

His teaching philosophy: **"First you should understand, then you should do."** He prioritizes conceptual clarity over speed.

## Approach (The Pitch)

Position EulaIQ as the tool that **upgrades his live tutoring sessions into polished, animated lessons** without losing the human warmth. Pitch it as:  
**"The patient tutor meets 3Blue1Brown"**—where his step-by-step explanations are enhanced with clean, professional animations that appear *exactly when he describes them*, making his lessons feel like a hybrid of Khan Academy's clarity and Manim's visual power.

The key insight: Rizwan already *narrates* the visuals he wants ("draw the graph", "mark this point", "this is the common point")—EulaIQ can **render those instructions automatically** so he doesn't have to manually draw or edit.

## Compliment (Opening Hook)

*"Your teaching style is like having a patient tutor in the room—the way you guide students through systems of equations with constant check-ins ('Are you understanding?') makes advanced math feel genuinely accessible. You don't just solve problems; you teach students **how to think** through them."*

## Video Context for Sample

**Video Title:** Solution of system of linear equation by graph or elimination method  
**Video URL:** https://youtu.be/2KtWzHtbinc?si=sC_pFbvvq8hI9sEu

**Reason (Visual Gap):**  
This video relies entirely on **manual drawing and verbal instructions** to plot points, draw axes, and identify intersection points. Currently, Rizwan verbally guides the student to:
- Write x-intercepts and y-intercepts
- Plot points like (1, 0) and (0, -1)
- Draw lines connecting those points
- Identify the solution at the intersection (x ≈ 3, y ≈ 1.9)

This is the **perfect use case** for EulaIQ: the system can listen to his narration and automatically render:
- Coordinate axes with labeled scales
- Points appearing as he calls them out
- Lines drawing themselves between intercepts
- The intersection point highlighted with coordinates displayed

The sample should focus on the **moment he says "draw the line between these points"** and show the line animating into place with clean labels.

## Context for Sample (Technical Directive)

**Scene to animate:**  
The segment where Rizwan solves the system:
- **Equation 1:** x - y = 1  
- **Equation 2:** 2x + y = 8

**Key moments to capture:**
1. **Finding intercepts** (timestamp ~5:00–8:00):
   - x-intercept of Equation 1: (1, 0)
   - y-intercept of Equation 1: (0, -1)
   - x-intercept of Equation 2: (4, 0)
   - y-intercept of Equation 2: (0, 8)

2. **Plotting and drawing** (timestamp ~8:00–10:00):
   - Coordinate plane appears with labeled axes
   - Points materialize as he calls them out
   - Lines draw themselves connecting the intercepts

3. **Identifying the solution** (timestamp ~10:00–11:00):
   - The two lines intersect
   - A highlighted point appears at the intersection
   - Text displays: **x ≈ 3, y ≈ 1.9**

**Animation style:**  
Clean, educational (3Blue1Brown-inspired). Use **smooth transitions** for points and lines appearing. Keep Rizwan's voice as the primary guide—animations should feel like they're responding to his instructions in real-time.

## DRAFT EMAIL TEMPLATE

**Subject:** I animated your linear systems lesson (Demo inside)

Hi Rizwan,

I've been watching your breakdown of solving systems of equations graphically, and I honestly love how you teach like a patient tutor—constantly checking in ("Are you understanding?") and guiding students through the thinking process, not just the answer.

I noticed that your lessons rely heavily on verbal instructions to draw graphs, plot points, and identify intersections. You're essentially *narrating* the visuals you want students to see.

I'm Victor from **EulaIQ** (part of the NVIDIA Inception program). We built an AI that listens to your voice and **automatically animates the math you're describing**. Instead of you having to manually draw axes and plot points, our system visualizes them appearing exactly when you say "mark this point" or "draw the line."

I tested EulaIQ on a 20-second clip of your linear systems video. It captured the moment you identified the x-intercepts and y-intercepts, then animated the lines drawing themselves and highlighting the intersection point—all synced to your narration.

I'd love to send you that sample clip so you can see what your tutoring sessions look like with high-end animation. **Reply with "Hi" if you're curious**, and I'll drop the link.

Warmly,  
**Victor Chukwujiobi**  
CEO, EulaIQ

**P.S.** There's no new software for you to learn. Our system works directly with the audio/video files you already record. You keep teaching the way you do—we just make it look like 3Blue1Brown.

**Internal Notes:**
- Rizwan's channel is small (754 subs) but highly engaged—his teaching style is **scalable** if paired with better visuals.
- His Facebook presence suggests he's building a tutoring brand—position EulaIQ as a tool to **professionalize his content** without changing his teaching approach.
- Sample should emphasize **time savings** (no more manual drawing) and **visual clarity** (students can focus on the math, not deciphering handwriting).
- Potential objection: "I like the personal feel of hand-drawn graphs." Counter: "EulaIQ keeps your voice and pacing—it just makes the visuals cleaner so students can follow along more easily."
