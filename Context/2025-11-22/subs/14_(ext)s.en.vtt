NOTE Video title: Algebra Basics: Graphing On The Coordinate Plane - Math Antics

00:00:06.665 --> 00:00:08.960
Hi, I’m Rob. Welcome to Math Antics!

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:11.250
If you been watching our Algebra Basics series,

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.900
you’ve learned a lot about equations so far.

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:17.500
But remember, equations aren’t the only
type of comparison in math.

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:22.686
There are also Inequalities like the ones
you’ve learned about in our video “Basic Inequalities”.

00:00:22.686 --> 00:00:26.312
Those sorts of comparisons use the greater-than and less-than signs,

00:00:26.312 --> 00:00:29.537
along with the versions of those that include the equal sign.

00:00:29.537 --> 00:00:31.320
And in this video, I’m going to show you

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.460
what happens when we use those signs in algebraic
equations,

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.640
like the equation of a line: y = mx + b.

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:44.429
What would it mean to have something like y &gt; mx + b instead?

00:00:44.429 --> 00:00:49.760
To answer that question, let’s first start with the very simple equation: y = x.

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:54.239
If you watched our video called “Basic Linear Functions” 
(and I highly recommend that you do)

00:00:54.239 --> 00:01:00.390
you’ll remember that y = x is just a special
case of the Slope-Intercept Form of a line

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:06.220
where m (the slope) equals 1 and b (the y-intercept)
equals 0.

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:11.350
This equation tells us that whatever value
x is, y must be the same:

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:13.694
if x is 0 then y is 0,

00:01:13.694 --> 00:01:15.850
if x is 1 then y is 1,

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:18.154
if x is 2 then y is 2.

00:01:18.154 --> 00:01:21.605
Every ordered pair that’s a solutions for this equation

00:01:21.605 --> 00:01:24.838
will have the same number for y that it does for x.

00:01:24.838 --> 00:01:27.735
And if we graph some of those points on the coordinate plane

00:01:27.735 --> 00:01:30.907
(connecting the dots to show that there are infinite possibilities)

00:01:30.907 --> 00:01:36.223
we get a diagonal line that goes right through 
the middle of the quadrants I and III.

00:01:36.223 --> 00:01:40.365
Now, what if we change this from the equation y equals x,

00:01:40.365 --> 00:01:44.000
to the inequality y is greater-than-or-equal-to x?

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.974
How would that effect our graph?

00:01:45.974 --> 00:01:49.670
To figure that out, we need to determine 
all the combinations of x and y 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:52.133
that would make this inequality true.

00:01:52.133 --> 00:01:57.560
Well fortunately, all of the solutions we
found for y = x will still work for this inequality

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.815
because it also contains the equal sign.

00:01:59.815 --> 00:02:03.164
That means that the diagonal line can stay on our graph.

00:02:03.164 --> 00:02:08.394
But the greater-than sign opens up a lot of new possibilities that would also make this statement true.

00:02:08.394 --> 00:02:12.200
For example, if we let x be 1, y could still be 1,

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.519
but it could also be any number that’s greater than 1…

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:19.159
…like y could be 2, or 3, or 4 just to name
a few possibilities.

00:02:19.159 --> 00:02:23.620
Let’s make ordered pairs out of those solutions
and set them aside for a second.

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:28.609
Then let’s ask, "what solutions are possible
if we let x be 0 instead?"

00:02:28.609 --> 00:02:34.100
Again, y could still be the same as x (0)
but it could also be any value greater than 0…

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:36.980
y could be 1 or 2 or 3 and so on.

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:39.532
Let’s make order pairs from those also.

00:02:39.532 --> 00:02:43.872
And then let's ask, "what are some possibilities if we let x be -1?"

00:02:43.872 --> 00:02:47.567
In that case, y could be -1 or anything greater-than -1,

00:02:47.567 --> 00:02:50.822
like 0 or 1 or 2 and so on.

00:02:50.822 --> 00:02:54.918
Now let’s take these new solutions we’ve found 
and graph them on the coordinate plane.

00:02:54.918 --> 00:02:58.229
Do you notice that all of these new points are above the diagonal line

00:02:58.229 --> 00:02:59.719
and none of them are below?

00:02:59.719 --> 00:03:01.531
…any guess as to why?

00:03:01.531 --> 00:03:03.725
Yep, it’s because on the coordinate plane,

00:03:03.725 --> 00:03:07.606
y-values increase as you go up and decrease
as you go down.

00:03:07.606 --> 00:03:10.915
This diagonal is the y = x line, right?

00:03:10.915 --> 00:03:16.170
Every point on the line has a ‘y value’ 
that’s exactly the same as its ‘x value'.

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:21.281
That means, that every point above the line has a ‘y value’ 
that’s greater-than its ‘x value’,

00:03:21.281 --> 00:03:25.817
while every point below the line has a ‘y
value’ that’s less-than its ‘x value’.

00:03:25.817 --> 00:03:29.077
In other words, the solutions to this inequality aren’t limited

00:03:29.077 --> 00:03:32.464
to just the handful of ordered pairs we identified so far.

00:03:32.464 --> 00:03:36.506
ANY point above the y = x line would make the inequality true,

00:03:36.506 --> 00:03:38.930
but NONE of the points below it will.

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:43.219
To show that fact on our graph, since we can’t
draw an infinite number of points,

00:03:43.219 --> 00:03:47.180
the convention is to just shade in that area
to cover all of them.

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:50.379
Now, that’s pretty easy to do with computer graphics,

00:03:50.379 --> 00:03:53.969
but there are also ways to do it on paper
with a pen or pencil.

00:03:53.969 --> 00:03:59.392
With a pencil you can shade in large areas
lightly by rubbing with the side of the pencil like this.

00:03:59.392 --> 00:04:02.432
With a pen, you can use a series of lines or hatch marks

00:04:02.432 --> 00:04:05.727
to suggest that the whole area is included in the graph.

00:04:05.727 --> 00:04:08.534
Getting back to our digital graph, as you might expect,

00:04:08.534 --> 00:04:12.279
if our inequality had used the 
less-than-or-equal-to sign instead,

00:04:12.279 --> 00:04:17.568
then all of the solutions would be on or below
the diagonal line like this.

00:04:17.568 --> 00:04:20.739
Because both of these inequalities include
the equal sign,

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:26.610
any point occurring directly on the y = x
line is included in the set of valid answers.

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:30.669
In fact, you can think of these inequalities
like combinations

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:37.740
of the equation y = x and the inequalities
y &gt; x and y &lt; x.

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:39.878
So what if we got rid of those equal signs

00:04:39.878 --> 00:04:43.880
and just used the pure greater-than and less-than signs instead?

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:47.899
In those cases, none of the points exactly on the y=x line

00:04:47.899 --> 00:04:50.195
would be a solution to the inequality,

00:04:50.195 --> 00:04:52.733
but how can we show that on our graph?

00:04:52.733 --> 00:04:57.844
Well, the convention is to draw a solid line when the points exactly on the line are included,

00:04:57.844 --> 00:05:01.308
but draw a dashed line when they are not included.

00:05:01.308 --> 00:05:04.242
Basically, the line serves as a boundary.

00:05:04.242 --> 00:05:08.226
On one side of it,  all the points are definitely in the solution set,

00:05:08.226 --> 00:05:12.631
and on the other side, 
all of the points are definitely outside the solutions set.

00:05:12.631 --> 00:05:15.590
As for the boundary itself, the question becomes,

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:18.000
“Is the line in or out?”

00:05:21.195 --> 00:05:24.664
Yes! Lines are out. My point.

00:05:24.664 --> 00:05:27.778
What are you talking about?! Lines are in!
That’s my point!

00:05:27.778 --> 00:05:29.853
Lines are out! Everyone knows that.

00:05:29.853 --> 00:05:30.701
Nuh Uh!

00:05:30.701 --> 00:05:33.789
Well if you’re so sure, just look it up online.

00:05:33.789 --> 00:05:35.534
Alright, I will!

00:05:37.504 --> 00:05:39.407
See… lines are in. 

00:05:39.407 --> 00:05:42.000
I suppose you believe everything on the internet.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.375
Fortunately, the rules for inequalities are easy to remember:

00:05:45.375 --> 00:05:47.883
If the inequality includes the equal sign,

00:05:47.883 --> 00:05:52.437
then the boundary line is in the solution set
and and you graph it with a solid line. 

00:05:52.437 --> 00:05:54.531
But if it does not include the equal sign,

00:05:54.531 --> 00:05:59.552
then you draw a dashed line to show that the boundary line 
is not in the solution set.

00:05:59.552 --> 00:06:02.746
Okay, so these four graphs should give you a pretty good idea

00:06:02.746 --> 00:06:05.479
of how graphing inequalities works in general.

00:06:05.479 --> 00:06:09.134
But now we need to go beyond the simple 
y = x equation

00:06:09.134 --> 00:06:11.426
to the general equation of a line.

00:06:11.426 --> 00:06:13.389
To do that, I’ll walk you through the process

00:06:13.389 --> 00:06:18.880
of graphing the linear inequality: 
y &lt; 2x - 3

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:21.277
That will involve 3 main steps:

00:06:21.277 --> 00:06:22.778
Graphing the boundary line.

00:06:22.778 --> 00:06:24.301
Picking a test point.

00:06:24.301 --> 00:06:26.823
And shading the proper side of the line.

00:06:26.823 --> 00:06:29.107
Let’s start with graphing the boundary line.

00:06:29.107 --> 00:06:34.064
To do that, first pretend that the inequality you have 
is actually an equation

00:06:34.064 --> 00:06:37.675
so that you can graph it exactly the same way you’d graph a line.

00:06:37.675 --> 00:06:42.410
That means re-writing it as y = 2x - 3.

00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:46.530
To graph that line, we just need to plot any
two points along it and connect the dots.

00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:48.911
It’s kinda like making a function table,

00:06:48.911 --> 00:06:53.610
but we only need to find the ‘y output’ values 
for two different ‘x input’ values.

00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:59.691
Any two points will do so I’m going to pick 
x = 2 and x = -2 to keep things simple.

00:06:59.691 --> 00:07:02.366
If x is 2, then y will be 1.

00:07:02.366 --> 00:07:05.867
And if x is -2 then y will be -7.

00:07:05.867 --> 00:07:10.719
Plotting those two points on the graph 
and then connecting the dots gives us this line,

00:07:10.719 --> 00:07:13.310
which is the boundary line of the inequality.

00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:18.112
But, are the points exactly along that line
included in the solution set?

00:07:18.112 --> 00:07:22.509
To answer that we need to check the inequality
sign of the original problem.

00:07:22.509 --> 00:07:27.169
In this case, since we have the less-than
sign that does NOT include the equal sign,

00:07:27.169 --> 00:07:30.379
the line itself won’t be included in the
set of valid answers

00:07:30.379 --> 00:07:34.020
so we’ll draw it with a dashed line 
instead of a solid line.

00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:36.710
Great! Now that we have our boundary line
correct,

00:07:36.710 --> 00:07:40.560
we need to figure out which side of the line
is in the answer set.

00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:43.199
To do that we need to pick a “test point”.

00:07:43.199 --> 00:07:47.820
Because we know that all the points on one
side of the line are in the answer set,

00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:50.370
and all the points on the other side are not,

00:07:50.370 --> 00:07:54.883
we only need to know the status of one point
to tell which side is which.

00:07:54.883 --> 00:07:58.729
In other words, if we can determine whether
the test point is in or out,

00:07:58.729 --> 00:08:02.219
we’ll know if that entire side is in or out.

00:08:02.219 --> 00:08:06.678
It doesn’t matter where the test point is
so feel free to pick something really easy to work with.

00:08:06.678 --> 00:08:12.137
I mean… why pick something like (-2.17, 3.59)

00:08:12.137 --> 00:08:15.930
when you could just pick (0, 0) or (1, 1).

00:08:15.930 --> 00:08:20.807
The only real restriction is that the test
point can’t be on the boundary line itself.

00:08:20.807 --> 00:08:23.344
Once you’ve decided which test point to try,

00:08:23.344 --> 00:08:27.749
plug its x and y values into the inequality
and then simplify it.

00:08:27.749 --> 00:08:33.918
For example, if we pick the point (0, 0)
we’d plug those x and y values into the inequality

00:08:33.918 --> 00:08:41.134
to get 0 &lt; (2 times 0 minus 3),
which simplifies to 0 &lt; -3

00:08:41.134 --> 00:08:46.545
But hold on a second… that’s not true!
0 is NOT less than -3.

00:08:46.545 --> 00:08:49.779
Ah! …that’s why it’s called a “test point”.

00:08:49.779 --> 00:08:53.550
The point that you choose can either pass or fail the test.

00:08:53.550 --> 00:08:59.182
In this case, since plugging the point’s x and y values
into the inequality gave us a false result,

00:08:59.182 --> 00:09:03.217
that means that the point is NOT a valid answer for the inequality.

00:09:03.217 --> 00:09:07.558
Therefore, (0, 0) must be on the side of the boundary line

00:09:07.558 --> 00:09:10.468
where NONE of the points are included in the solution set,

00:09:10.468 --> 00:09:14.660
which means ALL of the points on the other
side WILL be included.

00:09:14.660 --> 00:09:16.601
So that brings us to the last step.

00:09:16.601 --> 00:09:20.373
We just need to shade correct side of the line, like so.

00:09:20.373 --> 00:09:24.342
To summarize, if the test point you pick makes the inequality true,

00:09:24.342 --> 00:09:26.686
then you’ve picked a point that’s in the answer set

00:09:26.686 --> 00:09:31.090
which means that you’ll shade the same side 
of the graph that the test point is on.

00:09:31.090 --> 00:09:33.533
But if the test point gives you a false statement,

00:09:33.533 --> 00:09:35.834
then you know that it’s not in the answer set

00:09:35.834 --> 00:09:39.426
which means that you’ll leave that side
blank and shade the other side.

00:09:39.426 --> 00:09:42.701
So, that’s the basics of graphing inequalities,

00:09:42.701 --> 00:09:46.264
but there’s a couple more things that you’ll 
need to know to be successful at it.

00:09:46.264 --> 00:09:48.949
After-all, not every inequality that you encounter

00:09:48.949 --> 00:09:54.369
will be in a nice, easy to work with 
form like: y &gt; mx + b.

00:09:54.369 --> 00:09:57.153
You may get things that need to be simplified.

00:09:57.153 --> 00:10:00.290
Fortunately, you can solve or simplify inequalities

00:10:00.290 --> 00:10:03.087
almost the same way that you do with equations.

00:10:03.087 --> 00:10:05.087
All of the same principles apply, like combining

00:10:05.087 --> 00:10:06.571
like combining 'like' terms'

00:10:06.571 --> 00:10:09.143
and the idea that anything you do to one side

00:10:09.143 --> 00:10:11.683
needs to be done to the other side too.

00:10:11.683 --> 00:10:16.628
However, there are couple situations 
where you need to flip the inequality sign.

00:10:16.628 --> 00:10:19.050
You never had to worry about that with equations

00:10:19.050 --> 00:10:23.130
because order doesn’t matter when both sides
have the exact same value.

00:10:23.130 --> 00:10:27.170
But inequalities tell us that one side has
a greater value than the other

00:10:27.170 --> 00:10:31.918
and the open end of the inequality sign always
faces that greater side.

00:10:31.918 --> 00:10:35.570
That means that if you need to switch the
left and right sides of an inequality,

00:10:35.570 --> 00:10:38.070
you also need to switch the inequality sign.

00:10:38.070 --> 00:10:42.437
For example, if you have the inequality 2x &lt; y

00:10:42.437 --> 00:10:45.602
and you wanted to rearrange so that y comes first,

00:10:45.602 --> 00:10:48.700
you’d need to flip the inequality sign when you do that.

00:10:48.700 --> 00:10:53.679
So just remember; If you switch the sides,
switch the inequality sign.

00:10:53.679 --> 00:10:56.710
Another case where you need to switch the
inequality sign is

00:10:56.710 --> 00:11:01.509
whenever you multiply or divide both sides
by a negative number or term.

00:11:01.509 --> 00:11:03.874
You don’t need to do this for any other operations.

00:11:03.874 --> 00:11:07.870
You can add or subtract positive or negative
terms from both sides,

00:11:07.870 --> 00:11:13.445
and you can multiply or divide both sides by a POSITIVE term without needing to switch the inequality sign.

00:11:13.445 --> 00:11:18.800
It’s only when you multiply or divide both sides by a NEGATIVE that you need to flip it.

00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:24.470
To understand why that’s necessary, 
have a look at the simple inequality 2 &lt; 4

00:11:24.470 --> 00:11:29.206
and imagine what would happen if you multiplied both sides by -1.

00:11:29.206 --> 00:11:33.839
In a previous video about integers, you learned that multiplying by -1

00:11:33.839 --> 00:11:37.700
switches a number to the opposite side of the number line and vice verse.

00:11:37.700 --> 00:11:41.400
Doing that to two different numbers actually changes their order.

00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:46.647
Positive 2 is less than 4, but -2 is greater than -4.

00:11:46.647 --> 00:11:51.509
That's why every time you multiply or divide
both sides of an inequality by a negative,

00:11:51.509 --> 00:11:54.143
you need to switch the inequality sign.

00:11:54.143 --> 00:12:01.147
For example, suppose you’re given the inequality, 
-2y + 1 &gt; x + 5,

00:12:01.147 --> 00:12:03.981
and you need to solve it for y before you graph it.

00:12:03.981 --> 00:12:05.556
How would you do that?

00:12:05.556 --> 00:12:10.772
Well, we want to get y all by itself, but two things are currently being done to it.

00:12:10.772 --> 00:12:15.224
It’s being multiplied by -2 and 1 is being added to that term.

00:12:15.224 --> 00:12:19.661
Let’s undo those operations using order of operations in reverse.

00:12:19.661 --> 00:12:22.180
First, we’ll subtract 1 from both sides.

00:12:22.180 --> 00:12:27.585
On the left side, the +1 and the -1 
cancel out leaving just -2y,

00:12:27.585 --> 00:12:33.217
and on the right side the x + 5 - 1 
simplifies to x + 4.

00:12:33.217 --> 00:12:37.019
Notice we DIDN’T switch the inequality sign
when we did that operation.

00:12:37.019 --> 00:12:39.293
It’s still the greater than sign.

00:12:39.293 --> 00:12:43.370
But now, we need to get rid of the -2 that’s being multiplied by y.

00:12:43.370 --> 00:12:46.729
That can be done by dividing both sides by -2.

00:12:46.729 --> 00:12:52.463
Because that will change the sign of both sides,
we DO need to flip the inequality sign for this operation.

00:12:52.463 --> 00:12:56.815
It was the greater-than sign originally, 
but now it will become the less-than sign.

00:12:56.815 --> 00:13:02.337
On the left, the -2 over -2 cancel 
leaving positive y all by itself.

00:13:02.337 --> 00:13:06.830
And on the right, 
we divide the entire (x + 4) term by -2 

00:13:06.830 --> 00:13:10.812
which simplifies to -x/2 - 2.

00:13:10.812 --> 00:13:16.714
So the final result is y &lt; -x/2 - 2

00:13:16.714 --> 00:13:20.970
Alright… so now you know the basics of inequalities in algebra.

00:13:20.970 --> 00:13:25.825
You know how to graph an inequality using the three step process 
we learned in the first part of the video,

00:13:25.825 --> 00:13:30.600
and you also know that there are a couple situations 
where you need to flip the inequality sign

00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:33.477
when solving or simplifying inequalities.

00:13:33.477 --> 00:13:37.354
You may have noticed that we only worked with linear inequalities in this video,

00:13:37.354 --> 00:13:40.937
but the concepts we learned can all be extended to other algebraic functions

00:13:40.937 --> 00:13:43.052
that you may learn about in the future.

00:13:43.052 --> 00:13:46.870
All you really need to do is change step one of the graphing procedure

00:13:46.870 --> 00:13:51.399
from “graph the boundary line” 
to “graph the boundary function”.

00:13:51.399 --> 00:13:56.330
We covered a lot in their video, 
so it may help to re-watch it if you’re still a little confused.

00:13:56.330 --> 00:14:00.000
And the best way to make sure you really understand inequalities in algebra

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.671
is to try some practice problems on your own.

00:14:02.671 --> 00:14:06.501
