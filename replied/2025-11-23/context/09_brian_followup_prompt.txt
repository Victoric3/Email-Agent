**Subject:** Re: I animated your Unit Circle Mistakes video (The Sample)

Hi Brian,

Great to hear from you.

I went ahead and processed that segment of your "Unit Circle Mistakes" video. I specifically focused on the **5π/4 reference angle explanation** (06:34 - 07:40) because it’s a perfect example of where your teaching is flawless, but the hand-drawn diagram gets a bit crowded.

Here is the 60-second animated version we generated:
**[Watch the Sample Video Here](https://youtu.be/DJsfFysZJns)**

**What you’ll see:**
* **0:45:** The angle $\theta = 5\pi/4$ sweeps cleanly from the x-axis (no shaky marker lines).
* **0:59:** The reference angle ($\pi/4$) highlights in red exactly when you define it.
* **1:02:** The coordinate point $(-\sqrt{2}/2, -\sqrt{2}/2)$ reveals automatically synced to your voice.

**Next Steps:**
Given the volume of content you produce (and your busy schedule with the Real Estate Gallery), I’d prefer to walk you through the platform personally rather than sending a generic link. I want to show you exactly how this fits into your current recording workflow without adding extra editing time.

Are you free for a brief **15-minute onboarding call** later this week?

I can answer your questions, show you the dashboard, and if it makes sense, we can get your next batch of videos queued up.

Warmly,

Victor Chukwujiobi

P.S. I noticed you balance this channel with your real estate business—impressive. The goal of this walkthrough is to show you how we can take the visual production off your plate entirely.
