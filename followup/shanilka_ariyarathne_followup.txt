Subject: Apologies — your sample is ready

Hi Shanilka,

Thanks again for your interest — and sorry for the delay. We paused briefly while stabilising our pipeline so the demos we send are genuinely useful. I created a short sample from your video "The Hidden Power of Inductors — Why Coils Resist Change!" — watch it here: <SHANILKA_SAMPLE_LINK>

Short details on the sample and your questions:
- Sample details (timestamps/segments): <SHANILKA_SAMPLE_TIMESTAMPS>
- What’s AI-driven vs manual: The pipeline is fully automated — animations, diagrams, and timings are generated by our system. Creators will be able to guide assets via natural-language prompts and soon will get editing controls to tweak visuals and timing manually before finalizing the output.
- Equations & diagrams: Our renderer is designed for technical accuracy; the sample was created using our automated flow (no manual diagram edits). We may add optional manual review if you’d prefer a tuning pass.
- Private examples: We have internal test samples and can share a private example link if you’d like: <PRIVATE_EXAMPLE_LINK>
- Ownership: You retain full ownership. EulaIQ supplies the rendered assets under a production license and will not publish without your approval.
- Where we’re based and the name: EulaIQ is based in Canada. The name is a playful nod to Leonhard Euler — the 18th-century mathematician — and the Euler number (e); we chose it to reflect our focus on clear mathematical visuals and rigor.
- Early-access incentive: As an early-access creator you’ll receive a 50% discount at full release and lifetime priority support during our beta.

Would you like a short 15-minute walkthrough this week to review the equations and how we handle diagrams? If so, tell me a couple of times (timezone), or reply "Hi" to see the unlisted sample.

Warmly,
Godreigns Anyachebelu
EulaIQ

P.S. If you’d prefer we focus the sample on a particular segment (worked example only, or a diagram), say which timestamps and I’ll rebuild the sample.
